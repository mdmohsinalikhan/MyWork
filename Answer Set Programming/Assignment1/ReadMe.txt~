Use answer set programming to formalize and solve the graph-theoretical problem described as Assignment 1a. You should prepare a uniform encoding which is valid input for gringo and supposed to work for any graph specified in terms of its edge relation. Assignment-specific input/output predicates must be used in the program. Assignments 1b—1d are based on three graphs that can be accessed through the respective links. You are supposed to use these graphs as input when solving your problem (using clasp or any compatible answer set solver).






You are supposed to upload the following files related to your solution:

The uniform gringo-encoding, i.e., the source code of your answer set program, is submitted for 1a. Please keep any input or output predicates visible but hide any other auxiliary predicates you might have used with appropriate #hide and #show statements (see page 4 in the article about gringo).
Depending on the nature of the Assignment 1b—1d, you are asked either to submit an answer set, to count the number of answer sets, or to declare a parameter value of interest.
An answer set is represented in a file by listing output atoms true in the model on a single line where atoms are separated by spaces and which ends by a newline character. A number of models or a parameter value (like 123) is reported as the only (textual) content "123" of the file.

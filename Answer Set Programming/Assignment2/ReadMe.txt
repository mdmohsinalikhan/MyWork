Use answer set programming to formalize and solve the AI planning problem described as Assignment 2a. You should prepare a uniform encoding which is valid input for gringo and supposed to work for any problem instance (specified in terms of input predicates) and for any number k of time steps (specified from the command line). Assignment-specific input/output predicates must be used in the program. Assignments 2b—2d are based on specific problem instances that can be accessed through the respective links. You are supposed to use these instances as input when solving your problem (using clasp or any compatible answer set solver).




You are supposed to upload the following files related to your solution:

The uniform gringo-encoding, i.e., the source code of your answer set program, is submitted for 2a. Please keep any input or output predicates visible but hide any other auxiliary predicates you might have used with appropriate #hide and #show statements (cf. Assignment 1).
For Assignments 2b—2d, you are asked to submit an answer set. Consult Assignment 1 for a description how an answer set is represented in a file.

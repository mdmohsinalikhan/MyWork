Use answer set programming to formalize and solve the pentomino puzzle provided as Assignment 3a. You should prepare a uniform encoding which is valid input for gringo and supposed to work for any problem instance (specified in terms of input predicates) and for the parameter number k=3,4,5,6 (specified from the command line). Assignment-specific input/output predicates must be used in the program. Assignments 3b—3d are based on specific problem instances that can be accessed through the respective links. You are supposed to use these instances as input when counting the solutions (using clasp or any compatible answer set solver).


You are supposed to upload the following files related to your solution:

The uniform gringo-encoding, i.e., the source code of your answer set program, is submitted for 3a.
For Assignments 3b—3d, you are asked to submit the respective numbers of answer sets (corresponding to solutions). See Assignment 1 for a description how to represent numbers in files.

Whenever the FPU controller is receiving a (req_fpu,any) message it first checks whether there is any FPU free at that moment which can be granted. 
If there is no such then that means some other cores are using all of them and eventually they will be freed by them.
So the FPU  controller waits for at least one of the FPUs to be freed. When a FPU is freed by a core by sending the (free_fpu,j) message to the from_core channel,then the FPU controller reads the (free_fpu,j) message and it just grant the freed FPU
to the core who is requesing for any FPU. Thus it is guaranted that if there is a request for an FPU eventually it will be granted.

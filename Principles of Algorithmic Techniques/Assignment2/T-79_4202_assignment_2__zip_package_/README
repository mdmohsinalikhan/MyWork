Test inputs and outputs for programming assignment 2


In the subdirectories asgn02_1a, asgn02_1b, asgn02_2a, and asgn02_2b,
you will find example graphs for testing your solutions to the
respective programming problems.  Each file asgn02_NN/XX.graph
contains a single graph in DIMACS format, and the file
asgn02_NN/XX.outputs contains the corresponding output produced by a
valid solution to problem NN.  If there are several correct outputs,
XX.outputs contains one correct output per line.

The unix "grep" command can be used to test whether your program
outputs a line that is present in a file, e.g.

  myprogram <01.graph | grep -c -x -f 01.outputs

The above command line prints "1" if the output of "myprogram" is one
of the correct outputs in the file 01.outputs, and "0" if the output
is not correct.


Visualizing graphs (optional):

If your system has a Python 2.x interpreter and the Graphviz dotty
tool installed, you can try to visualize the graphs using the script
dimacs_to_dot.py provided in this package.  For example:

  python dimacs_to_dot.py <asgn02_1a/01.graph | dotty -

(Note the minus sign in the end.)  If the file is supposed to
represent an undirected graph, just ignore the arrowheads.
